# Youtube Example
This is a React + Express web application that leverages the Youtube API to request the change in views over a period of time.

## Development

You need a YouTube api key to run this locally, you can provide it to the
backend by running `YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<Your Key Here>` on Linux or 
`$Env:YOUTUBE_API_KEY = "<Your Key Here>"` on windows.
We can run the dev front end by running `npm start` in the root directory. 
We can run the backend using `npm run dev` in the `api` directory. 

## Production
The production server is entirely run out of the `api` directory. You can start
the production server by running `npm run build` in the root directory then 
`npm start` in the `api` directory.

## Deployment
This deploys to a non-scalable server. You need to:

1. Create a new user
2. Create a ssh key-pair for that user
3. Store username, IP, and key-pair in the repo
4. Pull the repo for the first time on the server.
5. Set up apache to reverse proxy the application.

Once this is set up the server will automatically be refreshed on pushes to
the main branch.
